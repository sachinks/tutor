"""Deterministic provider for tests, CI and the hosted demo: no network, no key, instant (design §4).

Embeddings are *hashed bag-of-words* vectors: each word is hashed to a position (and a sign) in the vector, and the
result is normalised to unit length. Texts that share words therefore get similar vectors, so retrieval, off-topic
detection and citations behave realistically without a model. The same text always gives the same vector.

Chat is rule-based: it finds the passage sentence that shares the most words with the student's message and, by mode,
quotes it (explain), asks about it (guide) or only points to it (hint), citing the passage label. Replies are clearly
marked as demo replies.
